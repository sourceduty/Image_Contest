> Compete against AI in an automated image contest using DALL-E 3.

#

[Image Contest](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-8gTIVkhaf-image-contest) was developed to facilitate an engaging and interactive image generation contest using the DALL-E 3 AI model. The process begins with Image Contest automatically generating a wide image to kick off the competition. Following this, users are prompted to enter their own text descriptions, which are then used to create a second image. This allows users to participate actively by providing their unique prompts and seeing the creative results generated by the AI.

Once both images are created, Image Contest compares and analyzes them to determine a winner based on creativity, relevance, and visual appeal. Each image is rated from 1 to 5 stars using the ‚≠ê emoji to reflect its quality. The contest can be replayed up to three times, offering users multiple opportunities to refine their prompts and enjoy different outcomes. This format ensures a dynamic and enjoyable experience for users, blending creativity with AI technology.
